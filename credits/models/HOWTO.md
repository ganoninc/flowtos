# How to use the credits/models folder #

**One image file = one credited person**

The file name format to be used is the following:

```Full Name#InstagramAccount.jpg```

*For instance:* Let's say John Lennon has an instagram account and uses @jlennon as username

To have him displayed on the Models section of the About page, we would have to place a picture of him in this folder named like this:

```John Lennon#jlennon.jpg```

**Note:** if John didn't have an instagram account, his picture's file name would be like this:

```John Lennon#.jpg```
