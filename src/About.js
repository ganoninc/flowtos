        As far as I remember, I've always loved taking pictures. I started my
        jourmey with the camera of my father, an old one with a very limited
        photographic film, with which each picture was precious. Then I won a
        compact ditial camera when I was 12 years old that eventually died when
        I was 17. A few years after the iPhone arrived in my life and changed
        everything. Eventually, one year ago I bought a professional digital
        camera and just 2 minutes after the transaction, I got hit by a car as
        pedestrian, but that's another story.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, I've enjoyed taking and editing those pictures and I
        hope you'll like them.
