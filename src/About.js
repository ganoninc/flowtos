        <i>Bonjour</i>, I'm Romain.

        As far as I remember, I've always loved taking pictures. I started my
        journey with the camera of my father, an old one with a very limited
        photographic film, with which each picture was precious. Then, I won a
        compact digital camera when I was 12 years old that eventually died when
        I was 17. A few years after the iPhone arrived in my life and changed
        everything because I was now able to carry a camera all the time, right
        in my pocket, always ready to shoot the sometimes unpredictable.
        Eventually, in December 19', I bought a professional digital camera to
        go beyond the limitations of my smartphone and just 2 minutes after the
        transaction, I got hit by a car as pedestrian, but that's another story.

        Long story short, I've enjoyed taking and editing those pictures and I
        hope you'll like them.
